# Introduction to JavaScript

### JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is widely used for both client-side and server-side development. It was originally developed to add interactive elements to web pages, but it has since grown into a full-fledged programming language capable of building complex applications.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Dynamic:** JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that types are determined at runtime rather than at compile-time.
- **Interpreted:** Traditionally, JavaScript is executed line-by-line by a browser or other runtime environment.
- **Event-Driven:** JavaScript can respond to events like user actions, making it ideal for interactive applications.
- **Prototype-Based:** JavaScript uses prototypes rather than classical inheritance, allowing for more flexible and dynamic object creation.

## Features of JavaScript

1. **Dynamic Typing:** Variables in JavaScript do not require a type declaration. For example:

   ```javascript
   let x = 5;     // x is a number
   x = "hello";   // x is now a string
   ```

2. **First-Class Functions:** Functions in JavaScript are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

   ```javascript
   function greet() {
       console.log("Hello, world!");
   }
   let sayHello = greet;  // Assigning function to a variable
   sayHello();            // Calling the function
   ```

3. **Asynchronous Programming:** JavaScript has native support for asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and `async/await` syntax.

   ```javascript
   async function fetchData() {
       let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
       let data = await response.json();
       console.log(data);
   }
   ```

4. **Event Handling:** JavaScript can handle various events like clicks, key presses, and form submissions, making it ideal for building interactive web pages.

   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
       alert("Button clicked!");
   });
   ```

5. **Prototypal Inheritance:** JavaScript objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through prototypes.

   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
       this.name = name;
   }
   Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
       console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
   };
   let john = new Person("John");
   john.sayHello();  // Outputs: Hello, my name is John
   ```

## Compiled, Interpreted, and JIT Languages

Understanding how JavaScript runs on machines involves knowing the difference between compiled, interpreted, and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled languages.

#### 1. **Compiled Languages**

Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. This compilation process happens before the program is run. Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Rust.

- **Example**: In C++, the source code is compiled into an executable file. Once compiled, the executable runs directly on the operating system, often leading to fast execution.

#### 2. **Interpreted Languages**

Interpreted languages are executed line by line by an interpreter. The source code is not compiled into machine code beforehand; instead, it is parsed and executed on the fly.

- **Example**: Python is an interpreted language. When you run a Python script, the interpreter reads the Python code, translates it into machine code, and executes it line by line.

#### 3. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiled Languages**

JIT compilation is a hybrid approach used by some modern languages, including JavaScript. In JIT compilation, the source code is initially interpreted, but parts of the code that are executed frequently are compiled into machine code at runtime. This process combines the flexibility of interpretation with the performance benefits of compilation.

- **Example**: JavaScript engines like Google's V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) and Mozilla's SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox) use JIT compilation. When a JavaScript program runs, the engine first interprets the code. It then identifies hot spots (frequently executed code) and compiles them into machine code for faster execution.

### Real-World Example of JIT Compilation in JavaScript

Consider a web application that involves complex animations and calculations. When a user interacts with the app, the JavaScript engine initially interprets the code. As the user continues to interact and the same functions are called repeatedly, the JIT compiler optimizes these hot functions into machine code, reducing execution time and improving performance. This is especially important in web applications where responsiveness is crucial for user experience.

In summary, JavaScript's versatility and the use of JIT compilation allow it to deliver high performance in web applications, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.

## Dynamically Typed vs. Statically Typed Languages

Understanding the difference between dynamically and statically typed languages is crucial for working with various programming paradigms, including those used in JavaScript.

### **Dynamically Typed Languages**

In dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than at compile time. This means that a variable can hold any type of data and can change its type during the execution of the program.

**Characteristics:**
- **Type Checking at Runtime**: The type of a variable is checked during the execution of the code. This can lead to more flexible and easier-to-write code, but it may also result in runtime errors if type mismatches occur.
- **No Need for Explicit Type Declarations**: Variables do not require explicit type declarations, which can make the code more concise.
- **Examples**: JavaScript, Python, Ruby.

**Real-World Example in JavaScript**:
```javascript
let value = 42;    // value is a number
console.log(typeof value); // "number"

value = "Hello";   // value is now a string
console.log(typeof value); // "string"
```
In this example, the variable `value` initially holds a number and later holds a string. The type is dynamically determined based on the assigned value.

### **Statically Typed Languages**

In statically typed languages, the type of a variable is known at compile time. This means that once a variable's type is declared, it cannot hold values of another type unless explicitly converted.

**Characteristics:**
- **Type Checking at Compile Time**: Errors related to type mismatches are caught during compilation, which can prevent certain types of bugs from making it into production.
- **Explicit Type Declarations**: Variables must be explicitly declared with a type, making the code more verbose but also more predictable.
- **Examples**: C, C++, Java, TypeScript (a statically typed superset of JavaScript).

**Real-World Example in TypeScript**:
```typescript
let value: number = 42; // value must be a number
value = "Hello"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```
In this TypeScript example, the variable `value` is declared as a number. Attempting to assign a string to it results in a compile-time error.

### JavaScript Engines and Typing

JavaScript itself is a dynamically typed language. However, modern JavaScript engines, such as V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) and SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), employ various optimization techniques to handle dynamic typing efficiently.

### **How JavaScript Engines Handle Dynamic Typing**

1. **Hidden Classes**: JavaScript engines use hidden classes to optimize property access. When an object is created, the engine internally generates a hidden class to describe its shape (the structure of its properties). If the objectâ€™s structure changes (e.g., a new property is added), a new hidden class is created. This helps the engine optimize property access and method lookups.

2. **Inline Caching**: This technique optimizes the retrieval of frequently accessed properties. When a property is accessed for the first time, the engine stores its location (cache) and can quickly retrieve it in subsequent accesses, avoiding repetitive lookups.

3. **JIT Compilation**: As mentioned earlier, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation helps convert frequently executed code into machine code. The JIT compiler uses type information collected at runtime to optimize the compiled code, reducing the overhead associated with dynamic typing.

4. **Type Inference**: JavaScript engines often perform type inference to predict the types of variables. This allows the engine to generate optimized machine code even in a dynamically typed environment.

#### **Conclusion**

While JavaScript is dynamically typed, modern JavaScript engines employ sophisticated techniques to optimize performance and reduce the overhead of dynamic typing. This allows developers to write flexible and expressive code while still achieving high performance in web applications.

## Learning Primitives in JavaScript

JavaScript has several built-in data types known as primitives. These are the basic building blocks of data in JavaScript and include:

1. **Number**
2. **String**
3. **Boolean**
4. **Undefined**
5. **Null**

Let's dive into each of these primitives with explanations and real-world examples.

#### 1. **Number**

**Definition**: The `Number` data type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. JavaScript uses a double-precision 64-bit binary format (IEEE 754) to store numbers.

**Characteristics**:
- Includes integers and floating-point numbers.
- Special values like `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (Not-a-Number).

**Examples**:
```javascript
let age = 30;           // integer
let temperature = 98.6; // floating-point number

console.log(typeof age);           // "number"
console.log(typeof temperature);   // "number"

console.log(1 / 0);  // Infinity
console.log(0 / 0);  // NaN
```

#### 2. **String**

**Definition**: The `String` data type represents a sequence of characters used for textual data. Strings in JavaScript can be enclosed in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``) for template literals.

**Characteristics**:
- Strings are immutable (cannot be changed once created).
- Template literals allow embedded expressions.

**Examples**:
```javascript
let name = "Alice";             // string with double quotes
let greeting = 'Hello, world!'; // string with single quotes
let message = `Welcome, ${name}`; // template literal

console.log(typeof name);       // "string"
console.log(message);           // "Welcome, Alice"
```

#### 3. **Boolean**

**Definition**: The `Boolean` data type represents a logical value that can be either `true` or `false`. Booleans are often used in conditional statements and logical operations.

**Characteristics**:
- Boolean values are the result of comparisons and logical operations.

**Examples**:
```javascript
let isAdult = true;  // boolean value

console.log(typeof isAdult); // "boolean"
console.log(5 > 3);  // true (comparison)
console.log(5 < 3);  // false (comparison)
```

#### 4. **Undefined**

**Definition**: The `undefined` type is a special value that indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

**Characteristics**:
- Automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized.
- Also the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return a value.

**Examples**:
```javascript
let result;
console.log(result); // undefined (variable declared but not initialized)

function greet() {
  // no return statement
}

console.log(greet()); // undefined (function returns no value)
```

#### 5. **Null**

**Definition**: The `null` type represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should be empty or has no value.

**Characteristics**:
- Unlike `undefined`, which is automatically assigned, `null` is explicitly assigned.

**Examples**:
```javascript
let user = null; // variable explicitly assigned with null

console.log(typeof user); // "object" (historical reason, not accurate)
console.log(user);        // null
```

### Summary of Primitives

- **Number**: Represents numerical values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
- **String**: Represents text data, which can be enclosed in single, double, or backticks.
- **Boolean**: Represents a true or false value.
- **Undefined**: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of a value.

These primitives are fundamental to JavaScript and are used to create and manipulate data in your programs. Understanding them is essential for effective JavaScript development.


## JavaScript strings

JavaScript strings come with a variety of built-in methods that allow you to manipulate and work with textual data. Here are some commonly used string methods, along with examples and explanations:

### Common String Methods

1. **`charAt(index)`**

   **Description**: Returns the character at the specified index.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello";
   console.log(str.charAt(1)); // "e"
   ```

2. **`concat(str1, str2, ...)`**

   **Description**: Joins two or more strings and returns a new string.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str1 = "Hello";
   let str2 = "World";
   console.log(str1.concat(" ", str2)); // "Hello World"
   ```

3. **`includes(substring)`**

   **Description**: Checks if a string contains the specified substring.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello World";
   console.log(str.includes("World")); // true
   console.log(str.includes("world")); // false (case-sensitive)
   ```

4. **`indexOf(substring)`**

   **Description**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring. Returns `-1` if not found.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello World";
   console.log(str.indexOf("World")); // 6
   console.log(str.indexOf("world")); // -1 (case-sensitive)
   ```

5. **`lastIndexOf(substring)`**

   **Description**: Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified substring. Returns `-1` if not found.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello World, World";
   console.log(str.lastIndexOf("World")); // 13
   ```

6. **`replace(search, replacement)`**

   **Description**: Replaces the first occurrence of a specified substring or regular expression with a new substring.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello World";
   console.log(str.replace("World", "JavaScript")); // "Hello JavaScript"
   ```

7. **`slice(start, end)`**

   **Description**: Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string. The `start` index is inclusive, and the `end` index is exclusive.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello World";
   console.log(str.slice(6, 11)); // "World"
   ```

8. **`split(separator)`**

   **Description**: Splits a string into an array of substrings based on the specified separator.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello World";
   console.log(str.split(" ")); // ["Hello", "World"]
   ```

9. **`substr(start, length)`**

   **Description**: Returns a substring starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello World";
   console.log(str.substr(6, 5)); // "World"
   ```

10. **`substring(start, end)`**

    **Description**: Returns a substring between the specified start and end indices. Unlike `slice`, `substring` does not accept negative indices.

    **Example**:
    ```javascript
    let str = "Hello World";
    console.log(str.substring(6, 11)); // "World"
    ```

11. **`toLowerCase()`**

    **Description**: Converts all characters in a string to lowercase.

    **Example**:
    ```javascript
    let str = "Hello World";
    console.log(str.toLowerCase()); // "hello world"
    ```

12. **`toUpperCase()`**

    **Description**: Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.

    **Example**:
    ```javascript
    let str = "Hello World";
    console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // "HELLO WORLD"
    ```

13. **`trim()`**

    **Description**: Removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

    **Example**:
    ```javascript
    let str = "  Hello World  ";
    console.log(str.trim()); // "Hello World"
    ```

14. **`startsWith(search)`**

    **Description**: Checks if a string starts with a specified substring.

    **Example**:
    ```javascript
    let str = "Hello World";
    console.log(str.startsWith("Hello")); // true
    ```

15. **`endsWith(search)`**

    **Description**: Checks if a string ends with a specified substring.

    **Example**:
    ```javascript
    let str = "Hello World";
    console.log(str.endsWith("World")); // true
    ```

### Summary

- **Manipulation**: Methods like `concat`, `replace`, and `split` help in modifying and breaking down strings.
- **Extraction**: `slice`, `substr`, and `substring` are used to extract parts of strings.
- **Inspection**: Methods such as `includes`, `indexOf`, and `lastIndexOf` help in inspecting and locating substrings within strings.
- **Formatting**: Methods like `toLowerCase`, `toUpperCase`, and `trim` help in formatting strings.

These methods provide powerful tools for working with strings, making it easier to handle and manipulate text data in JavaScript.

## 'Math' Object
The `Math` object in JavaScript provides a set of properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. It doesn't have to be instantiated; you use it directly via the `Math` global object. 

### Methods of the `Math` Object

- **`Math.abs(x)`**: Returns the absolute value of `x`.
  ```javascript
  console.log(Math.abs(-5)); // 5
  ```

- **`Math.ceil(x)`**: Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`.
  ```javascript
  console.log(Math.ceil(4.3)); // 5
  ```

- **`Math.floor(x)`**: Returns the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.
  ```javascript
  console.log(Math.floor(4.7)); // 4
  ```

- **`Math.round(x)`**: Rounds `x` to the nearest integer.
  ```javascript
  console.log(Math.round(4.5)); // 5
  console.log(Math.round(4.4)); // 4
  ```

- **`Math.max(x, y, ...)`**: Returns the largest of zero or more numbers.
  ```javascript
  console.log(Math.max(1, 3, 2)); // 3
  ```

- **`Math.min(x, y, ...)`**: Returns the smallest of zero or more numbers.
  ```javascript
  console.log(Math.min(1, 3, 2)); // 1
  ```

- **`Math.pow(base, exponent)`**: Returns the base to the exponent power.
  ```javascript
  console.log(Math.pow(2, 3)); // 8
  ```

- **`Math.sqrt(x)`**: Returns the square root of `x`.
  ```javascript
  console.log(Math.sqrt(16)); // 4
  ```

- **`Math.random()`**: Returns a pseudo-random floating-point number between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive).

### Generating Random Numbers in a Given Range

To generate a random number within a specific range, you can use the `Math.random()` method along with some arithmetic to scale the result to the desired range.

**Formula**:
```javascript
Math.random() * (max - min) + min
```
This formula generates a random floating-point number between `min` (inclusive) and `max` (exclusive).

**Example**: Generating a random number between 1 and 10.

```javascript
function getRandomNumber(min, max) {
  return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
}

console.log(getRandomNumber(1, 10)); // A random number between 1 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive)
```

**Generating a Random Integer**:

To generate a random integer within a range, you can combine `Math.random()` with `Math.floor()`:

**Formula**:
```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
```
This formula generates a random integer between `min` (inclusive) and `max` (inclusive).

**Example**: Generating a random integer between 1 and 10.

```javascript
function getRandomInteger(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

console.log(getRandomInteger(1, 10)); // A random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
```

### Summary

- **Math Object**: Provides mathematical constants and functions for various calculations.
- **Random Numbers**: Use `Math.random()` in combination with arithmetic functions to generate random numbers within a specific range.
- **Random Integers**: Use `Math.floor()` along with `Math.random()` to generate random integers within a range.

These tools and methods are essential for performing mathematical operations and generating random values in JavaScript.

## Conditional Statements and Operators in JavaScript

JavaScript provides several ways to handle conditions and make decisions in your code. Hereâ€™s an overview of the different types of conditional statements and operators, including if-else statements, the ternary operator, and various types of operators.

### 1. `if-else`, `if-else if-else`, and `else`

**`if` Statement**:
- Executes a block of code if its condition evaluates to `true`.

**Example**:
```javascript
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}
```

**`else` Statement**:
- Executes a block of code if the `if` condition evaluates to `false`.

**Example**:
```javascript
let age = 16;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not an adult.");
}
```

**`else if` Statement**:
- Provides an additional condition to check if the initial `if` condition is `false`.

**Example**:
```javascript
let score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: C");
}
```

### 2. Ternary Operator

**Syntax**:
```javascript
condition ? expr1 : expr2
```
- Evaluates `condition`. If true, `expr1` is executed; otherwise, `expr2` is executed.

**Example**:
```javascript
let age = 20;
let beverage = (age >= 18) ? "Beer" : "Juice";
console.log(beverage); // "Beer"
```

The ternary operator is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement and is useful for simple conditional assignments.

### 3. Binary Operators

Binary operators perform operations on two operands. Common binary operators include:

- **Arithmetic Operators**:
  - `+` (Addition)
  - `-` (Subtraction)
  - `*` (Multiplication)
  - `/` (Division)
  - `%` (Modulus)
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let a = 10;
  let b = 5;
  console.log(a + b); // 15
  console.log(a % b); // 0
  ```

- **Comparison Operators**:
  - `==` (Equal to)
  - `===` (Strict equal to)
  - `!=` (Not equal to)
  - `!==` (Strict not equal to)
  - `>` (Greater than)
  - `<` (Less than)
  - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
  - `<=` (Less than or equal to)
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  let y = 20;
  console.log(x < y); // true
  console.log(x === 10); // true
  ```

### 4. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or invert boolean values.

- **`&&` (Logical AND)**: Returns `true` if both operands are `true`.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let a = true;
  let b = false;
  console.log(a && b); // false
  ```

- **`||` (Logical OR)**: Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let a = true;
  let b = false;
  console.log(a || b); // true
  ```

- **`!` (Logical NOT)**: Inverts the boolean value.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let a = true;
  console.log(!a); // false
  ```

### 5. Bitwise Operators

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**

   **Description**: Performs a binary AND operation. Each bit of the result is `1` if the corresponding bits of both operands are `1`, otherwise `0`.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let a = 5;  // 0101 in binary
   let b = 3;  // 0011 in binary
   let result = a & b; // 0001 in binary
   console.log(result); // 1
   ```

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**

   **Description**: Performs a binary OR operation. Each bit of the result is `1` if at least one of the corresponding bits of either operand is `1`, otherwise `0`.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let a = 5;  // 0101 in binary
   let b = 3;  // 0011 in binary
   let result = a | b; // 0111 in binary
   console.log(result); // 7
   ```

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**

   **Description**: Performs a binary XOR (exclusive OR) operation. Each bit of the result is `1` if exactly one of the corresponding bits of either operand is `1`, otherwise `0`.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let a = 5;  // 0101 in binary
   let b = 3;  // 0011 in binary
   let result = a ^ b; // 0110 in binary
   console.log(result); // 6
   ```

4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**

   **Description**: Performs a binary NOT operation. Inverts all the bits of its operand (i.e., changes `1` to `0` and `0` to `1`). Note that it also applies a two's complement operation, effectively returning `-(n + 1)` where `n` is the number.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let a = 5;  // 0101 in binary
   let result = ~a; // 1010 in binary (in decimal, this is -6)
   console.log(result); // -6
   ```

5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**

   **Description**: Shifts the bits of the number to the left by a specified number of positions. The leftmost bits are discarded, and zeros are shifted in from the right.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let a = 5;  // 0101 in binary
   let result = a << 1; // 1010 in binary
   console.log(result); // 10
   ```

6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**

   **Description**: Shifts the bits of the number to the right by a specified number of positions. The rightmost bits are discarded. For positive numbers, zeros are shifted in from the left. For negative numbers, the sign bit (1) is shifted in from the left.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let a = 5;  // 0101 in binary
   let result = a >> 1; // 0010 in binary
   console.log(result); // 2
   ```

   For negative numbers:
   ```javascript
   let b = -5; // 11111111111111111111111111111111 in binary (32-bit signed integer)
   let result = b >> 1; // 11111111111111111111111111111111 in binary (with sign bit preserved)
   console.log(result); // -3
   ```

7. **Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`)**

   **Description**: Shifts the bits of the number to the right by a specified number of positions. Unlike `>>`, it always fills in with zeros from the left, regardless of the sign of the original number.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let a = 5;  // 0101 in binary
   let result = a >>> 1; // 0010 in binary
   console.log(result); // 2
   ```

   For negative numbers:
   ```javascript
   let b = -5; // 11111111111111111111111111111111 in binary (32-bit signed integer)
   let result = b >>> 1; // 01111111111111111111111111111111 in binary (unsigned result)
   console.log(result); // 2147483642
   ```

### Summary of Bitwise Operations

- **AND (`&`)**: Produces `1` if both bits are `1`.
- **OR (`|`)**: Produces `1` if at least one bit is `1`.
- **XOR (`^`)**: Produces `1` if exactly one bit is `1`.
- **NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all bits (two's complement).
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits to the left, discarding leftmost bits and filling with zeros.
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits to the right, preserving the sign for negative numbers.
- **Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`)**: Shifts bits to the right, filling with zeros from the left, regardless of sign.

These operators are particularly useful in low-level programming tasks, such as optimizing algorithms or performing bit manipulation.

## Short-circuiting
Short-circuiting is a behavior of logical operators in JavaScript where the evaluation of expressions stops as soon as the result is determined. This behavior is most commonly seen with the logical AND (`&&`) and logical OR (`||`) operators.

### Logical AND (`&&`)

**Short-circuiting Behavior**:
- **Evaluation**: The logical AND (`&&`) operator evaluates the second operand only if the first operand evaluates to `true`. If the first operand is `false`, the result is `false`, and the second operand is not evaluated.
  
**Example**:
```javascript
function getValue() {
  console.log("getValue called");
  return true;
}

let result = false && getValue();
console.log(result); // false
// "getValue called" is not logged because the second operand is not evaluated.
```

**Explanation**:
- Since `false` is the first operand, the result of the `&&` operation is guaranteed to be `false`, so JavaScript does not evaluate `getValue()`.

### Logical OR (`||`)

**Short-circuiting Behavior**:
- **Evaluation**: The logical OR (`||`) operator evaluates the second operand only if the first operand evaluates to `false`. If the first operand is `true`, the result is `true`, and the second operand is not evaluated.
  
**Example**:
```javascript
function getValue() {
  console.log("getValue called");
  return false;
}

let result = true || getValue();
console.log(result); // true
// "getValue called" is not logged because the second operand is not evaluated.
```

**Explanation**:
- Since `true` is the first operand, the result of the `||` operation is guaranteed to be `true`, so JavaScript does not evaluate `getValue()`.

### Practical Uses of Short-Circuiting

1. **Default Values**:
   - Short-circuiting can be used to provide default values. For example, if a variable is `null` or `undefined`, you can use the logical OR operator to set a default value.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let user = null;
   let defaultUser = "Guest";

   let currentUser = user || defaultUser;
   console.log(currentUser); // "Guest"
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - If `user` is `null` or `undefined`, `defaultUser` will be used as `currentUser`.

2. **Conditional Execution**:
   - Short-circuiting with `&&` can be used for conditional execution of code, where you only want to execute a function if a condition is true.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   let isLoggedIn = true;

   isLoggedIn && console.log("User is logged in");
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - If `isLoggedIn` is `true`, the message "User is logged in" will be logged to the console. If `isLoggedIn` is `false`, the `console.log` statement will not be executed.

3. **Guard Clauses**:
   - Short-circuiting can help prevent errors by ensuring that certain conditions are met before attempting operations that depend on them.

   **Example**:
   ```javascript
   function processUser(user) {
     user && user.profile && console.log(user.profile.name);
   }

   let user = { profile: { name: "Alice" } };
   processUser(user); // "Alice"

   user = null;
   processUser(user); // No error; nothing is logged.
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The function `processUser` checks if `user` and `user.profile` are truthy before trying to access `user.profile.name`, preventing errors when `user` is `null` or `undefined`.

### Summary

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Stops evaluating if the first operand is `false` because the result will always be `false`.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Stops evaluating if the first operand is `true` because the result will always be `true`.
- **Short-Circuiting Uses**: Useful for setting default values, conditional execution, and preventing errors by checking conditions before performing operations.

Understanding short-circuiting helps in writing efficient and error-free code by leveraging these logical operators for conditional operations.
